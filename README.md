   # Family Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains code and tools developed for the paper Discovering Predisposing Genes for Hereditary Breast Cancer Using Deep Learning (https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/25/4/bbae346/7717952).

# Overview

The FamAnalysis pipeline processes large datasets of missense variants and ranks them based on their pathogenicity compared to other variants in the dataset.
We provide here a user-friendly command line interface of the DSRank methodology outlined in our [paper](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/25/4/bbae346/7717952). We hope to extend the interface to include FamRank in the near future.

**Updates to current version:** 
1. we have now replaced [FIRM](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/13/6642/5523008) with [AlphaMissense](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg7492) precomputed scores.
2. We have also replaced [ESM-1v](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.09.450648v2) inference with precomputed scores obtained from [ESM-1b](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.12.430858v2)
   as described in the study [Genome-wide prediction of disease variant effects with a deep protein language model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01465-0) - official GitHub repository (https://github.com/ntranoslab/esm-variants.git).
4. The current version can run on standard CPUs and does not require direct model inference using GPUs.

**The pipeline consists of 3 stages:**
1. Create protein and mutations objects based on input data by pulling all relevant metadata from UniProtKB. 
2. Calculate pathogenicity scores using ESM, AlphaMissense and [EVEmodel](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04043-8).
3. Normalize models scores and rank variants using an aggregated score - DSrank (see paper).

# Setup

## Hardware requirements

The entire pipeline can run on standard CPU. To install the database and precomputed scores, make sure to have at least 23GB free on disk. 

## Software requirements

FamAnalysis requires python 3.10

## Installation 

After cloning the project, run:

`pip install pandas requests tqdm psutil click wget bio ` 

`python setup.py`

In `definition.py`, make sure to set `CONTACT` to your email address. This is required for UniProtKB requests.

**Note:** In case of an unstable internet connection, `setup.py` may raise a `ConnectionError` while downloading large files. 
Simply re-run the program starting from the method that crashed. The download will resume from the point where it stopped.

# Running FamAnalysis 
Run the following command to get help:

`python main.py --help`

set verbose level using the `--verbose` flag.

Protein variants should be provided in the format shown in `example.csv`.

**Note:** DNA data (i.e., Chr, Start, End) is not required. If these fields are not available, please fill them with any arbitrary value.

## Initializing Database

To build protein and mutation objects for all variants run: 

`python main.py --data-path example.csv --action init-DB`

To limit CPUs used, run:

`python main.py --data-path example.csv --action init-DB --workers 16`

**Note:** When using > 16 CPUs or if internet connection is unstable it may be required to increase `TIMEOUT`, `WAIT_TIME` and `RETRIES` values in `definitions.py`

## Calculating Models Scores

To calculate model scores for all variants, run:

`python main.py --data-path example.csv --action score-AFM`

`python main.py --data-path example.csv --action score-ESM`

`python main.py --data-path example.csv --action score-EVE`

To re-calculate scores for variants that were previously scored, run:

`python main.py --data-path example.csv --action score-EVE --recalc 1`

To use only EVEmodel without using [CPT](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-023-03024-6) imputation, run:

`python main.py --data-path example.csv --action score-EVE --use-cpt 0`

To set offset for mutation position, run:

`python main.py --data-path example.csv --action score-EVE --offset 1`

**Note** changing the offset from default is not recommended and should preferably be handled at the input file. 

## Ranking Scores

FamAnalysis uses DSRank to aggregate the model scores. The normalized scores of the three ML modelsâ€™ predictions are averaged over all available scores per variant. 

To rank all variant, run:

`python main.py --data-path example.csv --action rank-DS `

use `--ds-thr` flag to set the threshold for the minimal number of model scores needed to calculate DSRank.

## Results

To create a CSV file summarizing all scores, run:

`main.py --data-path example.csv --action to-csv --out-path results.csv`

use `--include-type 1` to include esm and eve score types in output file.
